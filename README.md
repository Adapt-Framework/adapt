# Adapt PHP Framework
Adapt is an enterprise grade PHP framework that was designed for rapid web application development and deployment.

Adapt has been used commerically for over 10 years and we are now happy to release 2.0 to the world with an MIT license giving you maximum freedom to do what you do.

## Rapid development
Time is money after all, so with that in mind Adapt has been designed with the following:
* Tiny learning curve, and it's really simple.
* Truly re-usable componets, you will only ever write once with Adapt.
* Many componets already available, from rich fully featured email to enterprise grade permission models.

## Rapid deployment
With so many ways to deploy code, you'd think that we would have let this one go. Nope, we ofter instead, the Adapt way.
* Continuious integration, update production applications with ease and without error.
* Single file installer, deploy to any web server quickly and easily.
* From development, to staging, to production without any complex third party software.

## Adapt 101
Adapt is a PHP framework and a bundle management system all rolled into one. A bundle is just a bunch of useful code packaged with a name and a version number.  Anything written in Adapt must be a bundle, componets are bundles, web applications are bundles, even Adapt is a bundle.

Bundles can depend on bundles, allowing code to be broken down and packged for re-use.  Adapt makes it easy to install bundles, you just add a dependency to your bundle and Adapt downloads and installs it for you.

Adapt offers a lot of bundles so the most common web application features can be included on demand saving many hours of development.

Here is a handful of useful bundles available already:
* Email, full support for sending and receiving, works without any configuration requirements.
* Task scheduling, basically cron for PHP.  Execute large background operations on a regular basis with ease.
* User account management, users and user management made easy.
* Enterprise grade roles and permissions.
